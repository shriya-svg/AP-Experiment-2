# AP-Experiment-2
Array is a linear data structure where all elements are arranged sequentially. It is a collection of elements of same data type stored at contiguous memory locations.

There are majorly two types of arrays, they are:

One-Dimensional Arrays:

You can imagine a 1d array as a row, where elements are stored one after another.
Multi-Dimensional Arrays:
These multi-dimensional arrays are again of two types. They are:

Two-Dimensional Arrays:

You can imagine it like a table where each cell contains elements.
